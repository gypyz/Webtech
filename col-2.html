      <h1>Rhe Atomic Age and J. Robert Oppenheimer</h1>
      <p>
        J. Robert Oppenheimer, a key figure in the Manhattan Project during
        World War II, played an integral role in the development of the atomic
        bomb. Renowned as a brilliant physicist, he led the team that
        successfully detonated the first nuclear weapon in 1945
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the war, Oppenheimer became a vocal advocate for nuclear
        regulation. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb, emphasizing
        the need for international control over nuclear power. This stance
        highlighted his commitment to ethical scientific practices in the
        post-war era.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, during the Red Scare, Oppenheimer faced severe accusations of
        communist sympathies. This led to a controversial public hearing that
        stripped him of his security clearance, tarnishing his reputation.
        Despite these challenges, Oppenheimer's contributions to physics and his
        influence on nuclear policy remained significant until his death in 1967
